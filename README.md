# PasswordDetector
Password detection script for [NZBGet](http://nzbget.net).

Detect nzbs with password protected .rar archive.

If a password is detected the download is marked as bad or paused. This status informs other scripts about failure and allows NZBGet to choose another duplicate for download (if available).
